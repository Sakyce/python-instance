# Roblox-Like Python Instance
A small project to learn about Composites patterns.

## How to use
In `example.py`, the output looks like this:
```
-> Workspace
--> Model
---> Part
---> Part
---> Part
---> Model
----> Part
----> Part
----> Part
----> Part
----> Part
----> Part
```

## Why ?
I'm very used to the approach of Composites trees for programming a video game, like Roblox. Which uses a Workspace Instance that contains every models the Players can see for example.
